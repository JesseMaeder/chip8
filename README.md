# [C]HIP-8
A CHIP-8 emulator written in C. Interested in emulation, I found that this system 
is a good starter project for those interested in developing emulators, due to its 
simple design and small number of opcodes to implement.

## Running this project
Download the code and compile it with `make`.

Usage: `./chip8 <game_file>`
- `<game_file>`: relative path to an assembled CHIP-8 game
